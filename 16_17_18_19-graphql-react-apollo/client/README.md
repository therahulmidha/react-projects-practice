# GraphQL

A way to query data, similar to REST but here we can ask for a specific thing. Suppose we want title field from an array of objects, in REST, we would fetch all data, parse it then pull out title like, const {title} = data;

But in GraphQL, we get anything we want without getting all.
We have a query language that we can use to get the desired data.

In graphql, we have just one route:
/graphql

And we build a schema in this route to do all operations.
